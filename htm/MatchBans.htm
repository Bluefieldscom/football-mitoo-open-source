    <td align="justify" valign="top"><span class="pix13bold"> It is my understanding 
      that, as of season 2011-2012, all adult leagues have to be able to suspend 
      their players on a &quot;number of matches&quot; basis (as well as &quot;number 
      of days&quot;). 
      <p>I have added a new link, <u>Match Bans</u>, which will report on the 
        status of all such player suspensions. This will display all the games 
        that contribute to the number of matches for which a player is suspended. 
        Only by clicking on the Match Bans link will the latest situation be displayed. 
      </p>
      <p>When the correct number of games have been played to a result then the 
        suspension will have been completed. The system automatically identifies 
        all these games and automatically clears the suspension.</p>
      <p>A ban will not be reduced by a postponed, awarded, abandoned or void 
        match. These games will be displayed but will not count. However, if a 
        game was played but then later awarded because of, say, an ineligible 
        player, then the game will count.</p>
      </span></td>
		<td align="justify" valign="top"><span class="pix13bold">Certain competitions 
        will not count towards the reduction, e.g. charity or testimonial matches. 
        These can be identified by using the <u>Constitution</u> link. If a club 
        enters several County Cup competitions then there may be &quot;extra&quot; 
        cups that don't count. Again, use the <u>Constitution</u> link to identify 
        these situations.</p> </span>
      <span class="pix13bold"><p>Match bans are normally applied a fixed number of days after the triggering 
        event (e.g. red card or five yellow cards). It is possible that during 
        this period there may be one or more additional triggering events. Match 
        bans may therefore overlap. The system correctly identifies these situations 
        so that concurrent or overlapping bans are made consecutive. Double-Headers count as two matches.</p>
      <p>A player may appear for the first team, reserve team and the 'A' team. 
        If the suspension was triggered by an event while playing for the first 
        team then it will be first team games that are counted, if the suspension 
        was triggered by an event while playing for the reserve team then it will 
        be reserve team games that are counted etc. When adding a suspension you 
        must identify the team; first, reserve, 'A' etc. Regardless of team, the 
        rules applying to concurrent or overlapping bans still apply.</p>
