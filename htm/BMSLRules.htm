Committee. Failing such agreement and notification to the (Fixtures/Match)
Secretary within 7 days the Management Committee shall have power to order
the match to be played on a named date or on or before a given date. The
Management Committee shall review all abandoned matches and in a case where
it is to the advantage of the Competition and does no injustice to either
Club, shall be empowered to order the score at the time of the abandonment
to stand. In all cases where the Management Committee are satisfied that
a match was abandoned owing to the conduct of one team or its Club member(s)
they shall be empowered to award the points for the match to the opponents
and/or take what other action they may deem necessary. In cases where a match
