<p style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How to Manage Cookies</strong></p>
<p><strong>How this website uses cookies on its websites</strong></p>
<p>We use cookies and similar tools across our websites to improve their performance and enhance your user experience. This policy explains how we do that.</p>
<p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognise your device the next time you visit. Web beacons or other similar files can also do the same thing. We use the term 'cookies' in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way.</p>
<p>There are many functions cookies serve. For example, they can help us to remember your username and preferences, analyse how well our website is performing, or even allow us to recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.</p>
<p>Certain cookies contain personal information � for example, if you click to �remember me� when logging in, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies won�t collect information that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use our websites, or a user�s general location.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of cookies does this website use?</strong></p>
<p>Generally, our cookies perform up to four different functions:</p>
<p>1. <i>Essential cookies</i></p>
<p>Some cookies are essential for the operation of our website. For example, some cookies allow us to identify subscribers and ensure they can access the subscription only pages. If a subscriber opts to disable these cookies, the user will not be able to access all of the content that a subscription entitles them to.</p>
<p>2.<i> Performance Cookies</i></p>
<p>We utilise other cookies to analyse how our visitors use our websites and to monitor website performance. This allows us to provide a high quality experience by customising our offering and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages. We might also use these cookies to highlight articles or site services that we think will be of interest to you based on your usage of the website.</p>
<p>3.<i> Functionality Cookies</i></p>
<p>We use functionality cookies to allow us to remember your preferences. For example, cookies save you the trouble of typing in your username every time you access the site, and recall your customisation preferences, such as site appearance settings that you may have customised when you log in. </p>
<p>We also use functionality cookies to provide you with enhanced services such as allowing you to watch a video online or comment on a blog. </p>
<p>4. <i> Behaviourally Targeted Advertising Cookies</i></p>
<p>This site and our advertisers use cookies to serve you with advertisements that we believe are relevant to you and your interests. You might see these advertisements on this website and on other sites that you visit. However, we do not tell our advertisers who you are.</p>
<p><strong>Does anyone else use cookies on this website</strong></p>
<p>Advertisers sometimes use their own cookies to provide you with targeted advertising. For example, advertisers may use a profile they have built on sites that you have previously visited to present you with more relevant advertisements during your visit to this website. We believe that it is useful to our users to see advertisements that are more relevant to their interests. If you are based in the European Union and would like to learn more about how advertisers use these types of cookies or to choose not to receive them, please visit  <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. If you are based in the United States and would like to learn more, please visit
<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>
<p>We also use or allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into the four categories above. For example, like many companies, we use Google Analytics to help us monitor our website traffic. We may also use third party cookies to help us with market research, revenue tracking, improving site functionality and monitoring compliance with our terms and conditions and copyright policy. </p>
<p><strong>Can a website user block cookies?</strong></p>
<p>As we�ve explained above, cookies help you to get the most out of our websites. </p>
  <p>The first time you accessed our website after 10th August 2012, you should
    have seen a message which explained that by continuing to access our site,
    you are consenting to our use of cookies.</p>
<p>However, if you do wish to disable our cookies then please follow the instructions on our <a href="http://football.mitoo.com/cookie_management.html">'How to Manage Cookies'</a> page.</p>
<p>Please remember that if you do choose to disable cookies, you may find that certain sections of our website do not work properly</p>
<p><strong>Do we track whether users open our emails?</strong></p>
<p>Our emails may contain campaign-unique �web beacon pixel� to tell us whether our emails are opened and verify any clicks through to links or advertisements within the email. We may use this information for purposes including determining which of our emails are more interesting to users, to query whether users who do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them and to inform our advertisers in aggregate how many users have clicked on their advertisements. The pixel will be deleted when you delete the email. If you do not wish the pixel to be downloaded to your device, you should select to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.</p>

<p><strong>Opting Out Of Advertising Cookies</strong></p>
<p>As well as using the information provided on the <a href="http://football.mitoo.co/cookie_management.html">'How to Manage Cookies'</a> Page, the partner company responsible for serving advertising onto our website have developed a solution for users to opt-out of receiving any further advertising cookies from this site by dropping a final cookie. This will allow them (the advertising partner) to identify a user as having opted out, and then refrain from serving that user any targeted advertising. Please be aware that this does not mean you will not see advertising, only that adverts will not be targeted to you, the user.</p>
