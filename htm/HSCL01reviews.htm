<B><FONT FACE="Verdana"><P>Weekend Review for the 27th April 2002</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>  For the second successive season the Premier Division title will be decided by the last match of the season. Sun Postal Sports gained the victory they needed to return to top spot two points ahead of reigning champions Oxhey Jets who play their final match on Monday. Sun left it desperately late at lowly Elliott Star before recording a 1-0 away victory with an 89th minute goal. Now, if Oxhey win their last game at home to Wormley Rovers on Monday night they’ll retain their title. Any other result and Sun will be crowned champions. Sandridge Rovers beat Croxley Guild 4-1 to ensure Guild finish second bottom whilst Rovers climb to sixth.</P>
<P>Thursday evening’s Chairman’s Cup Final will be between Bedmond Sports and Wormley Rovers – the game to be staged by Bedmond. That’s after Bedmond overcame Chipperfield Corinthians 2-1 in one semi whilst Wormley Rovers beat surprise packets Standon &amp; Puckeridge 3-0 in the other semi. Kick off at Toms Lane is scheduled for 6.30pm.</P>
<P>In Division One Champions Hadley finished with a 1-1 home draw against North Mymms whilst Bushey Rangers celebrated their runners up finish with a 6-1 win at Benington.</P>
<P>The Reserve Cup Final, played at Lemsford, saw League status adhered to with Reserve Division One Champions Oxhey Jets beating Reserve Division Two Champions London Lions 5-0. In fairness to Lions they weren’t five goals worst than the Jets and for spells matched their opponents for industry. An early goal for Jets didn’t help their cause but the score remained 1-0 at the interval. Lions enjoyed their best spell early in the second period but never really looked like scoring. In the final 15 minutes the floodgates opened and once Oxhey scored their second goal the tie was effectively over. Three more goals followed as the referee extended Lions misery with six or so minutes of injury time. Disappointment though for Jets in this period as they had a player sent off. So the Oxhey Jets Reserve side have now completed a League and cup double and now wait to see if the First team can emulate them – the next nine days will reveal the answer.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Verdana"><P> Weekend Review for the 20th April 2002</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>  The Premier Division title battle now looks certain to go to the final game as Oxhey Jets caught up on their backlog of League fixtures with a 5-2 victory at Elliott Star whom they beat 11 days ago in the Herts Senior Centenary Cup Final. The three points from the game added to the three picked up in midweek when they beat fourth placed Bovingdon 3-1 means they now have 51 points just two behind leaders Sun Postal Sports. Jets have two games left whilst Sun have just one. At the other end of the table, Hatfield Town are confirmed in bottom spot following a 3-2 home defeat at the hands of second bottom Croxley Guild. Guild could yet climb out of the bottom three if they can win their final matches. Metropolitan Police Bushey can’t escape a bottom three placing though as they lost their crucial final match 1-0 at St Peters who ensured their own safety with the three points. Elliott Star still need a point to be safe. They lost 2-0 in midweek at Wormley Rovers and then today, as mentioned earlier. The final Premier Division game of the day saw Cuffley record a 2-0 home win over Sandridge Rovers. The result gives Cuffley a mid-table berth after a season of internal turmoil.</P>
<P>In Division One Hadley confirmed the Championship with a 6-0 drubbing of strugglers Benington. That result along with Old Parmiterians 3-0 victory at second placed Bushey Rangers means the Londoners can’t be caught. Parmiters could yet finish runners up though if they win their last match and Rangers fail to win theirs.</P>
<P>The Chairman’s Cup semi-finals were confirmed as Wormley Rovers beat The Cheshunt Club 6-1 to win Group C and Standon &amp; Puckeridge, the competitions surprise side, beat Welwyn 3-2 to finish level on points with Wormley Rovers and top runners-up from the three groups.</P>
<P>Bedmond Sports now entertain Chipperfield Corinthians in one semi whilst Wormley Rovers entertain Standon &amp; Puckeridge in the other. Both games take place next weekend with the final scheduled for the following Thursday evening.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Verdana"><P> Weekend Review for the 13th April 2002</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>  Both main League titles continue to remain up for grabs following this weekends results.</P>
<P>In the Premier Division it’s a two horse race with Bovingdon bowing out of the battle following a 3-2 defeat at Sandridge Rovers. Sun Postal Sports remain favourites following their 4-0 victory at relegation haunted Metropolitan Police Bushey. Oxhey Jets are now the only team who can overhaul them and they kept their hopes alive with a 3-0 win at Cuffley. At the bottom, Elliott Star appear to have saved themselves following a 2-1 victory at fellow strugglers Croxley Guild they are now three points clear of the bottom three and have a better goal difference. St Peters are still in the mire though following a 2-1 defeat at relegated Hatfield Town. Saints with 27 points are just a point above third bottom Met. Police.</P>
<P>Only one match in Division One but a hugely significant one. Hadley lost their unbeaten home record to second placed Bushey Rangers and although they remain top with a game in hand, the 3-1 victory moves Rangers to within a point.</P>
<P>In the Chairman’s Cup, Bedmond clinched Group A after a goalless draw at Old Parmiterians. Lemsford are runners-up in the group following a 5-0 victory over North Mymms. Chipperfield Corinthians won Group B without a ball being kicked, Sarratt unable to field a team against their near neighbours. Evergreen moved into second spot with a 3-0 home victory over Mill End Sports. Group C remains open. Wormley Rovers top the group on goal difference following an 8-0 thrashing of Welwyn but Standon &amp; Puckeridge have the same points total after their 3-2 victory at The Cheshunt Club.</P>
<P>Finally, double congratulations to Oxhey Jets. On Tuesday evening at Letchworth they recorded their first ever success in the Herts Senior Centenary Trophy Final, beating fellow County League side Elliott Star in a hugely entertaining match which ended 4-3. Then on Wednesday evening their Reserves retained the Reserve Division One title following a 3-0 home win over challengers Bedmond Sports.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana"><H4> Weekend Review for the 6th April 2002</H4>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>  The battle for the Premier Division crown and to avoid relegation continues to rage at either end of the table. Sun Postal Sports maintained the League leadership with a comfortable 3-0 home win over one time challengers London Lions. Lions closed their campaign somewhat tamely and having occupied a top three spot for virtually the whole season end in fifth place. Bovingdon maintained the pressure on Sun with a 4-0 away victory at relegation haunted Croxley Guild. Still mathematically in the hunt are reigning champions Oxhey Jets. They scored a useful 2-0 away success at St Peters but are still eight points off the pace with three matches in hand. Cup commitments may yet decide their fate. Defeat for St Peters leaves them nervously looking over their shoulders as they now sit just one point above the relegation zone. Cuffley moved a little way clear of the relegation fight with a 4-1 home win over Hatfield Town whose fate is now sealed. The major game at the bottom saw Elliott Star record a vital 4-1 win at Metropolitan Police Bushey. The two clubs are now level on points but swap places on goal difference with Star out of the bottom three as they look ahead to Tuesday evenings Herts Centenary Trophy Final against Oxhey Jets at Letchworth. In a mid table clash, Wormley Rovers recorded a creditable 3-1 away win at Sandridge Rovers.</P>
<P>Only two matches in Division One. Hadley improved their championship prospects with a 1-0 home win over Evergreen whilst at the foot of the table Benington recorded a 4-2 home success against Sarratt. Sarratt remain bottom whilst Benington climb to fourth bottom.</P>
<P>In The Chairman’s Cup, Bedmond Sports retained their 100% record in Group A with a hard fought 2-1 home win over Division One outfit North Mymms. Lemsford moved into second spot in the Group with a 1-0 home victory against Old Parmiterians. Chipperfield Corinthians maintained a 100% record in Group B following a close 1-0 success at Mill End Sports. In Group C, Welwyn are the surprise leaders following a 6-1 thrashing of The Cheshunt Club.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana"><H4> Weekend Review for the 30th March 2002</H4>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>  Sun Postal Sports maintained their hopes of a Premier Division and Aubrey Cup double with a hard fought point at relegation threatened Cuffley – the result 1-1. Bedmond Sports &amp; Social demonstrated they haven’t yet given up on the title with an impressive 2-0 win at reigning champions Oxhey Jets. The result puts Bedmond level on points with Sun but having played two games more. Jets are now eight points behind the leaders but have two games in hand. At the other end of the table, Croxley Guild picked up a valuable three points with a 2-0 home win against St Peters. Guild remain second from bottom but are now only five points adrift of safety and have two games in hand. That safe spot is occupied by Metropolitan Police Bushey who went down 2-1 at Sandridge Rovers in the battle of the beaten Aubrey Cup semi-finalists.</P>
<P>In Division One Hadley regained top spot with a 6-0 thrashing of The Cheshunt Club at The Whitewebbs Centre. Bushey Rangers also leapfrogged morning leaders Old Parmiterians thanks to a 3-2 home win against Kimpton Rovers. Congratulations to Benington. As April looms they finally recorded their first home win of the season, 2-1 over Welwyn to remain above their opponents and bottom place Sarratt.</P>
<P>In the Chairman’s Cup, Premier Division Chipperfield Corinthians narrowly edged out Division One side Evergreen 2-1. Standon &amp; Puckeridge achieved perhaps the best result of the afternoon holding their Premier Division opponents 2-2. Elsewhere North Mymms and Old Parmiterians also drew 2-2 whilst Mill End Sports hammered Sarratt 9-0.</P>
<P>The Reserve Cup Final will be between London Lions and Oxhey Jets. Reserve Division Two highfliers London Lions overcame Reserve Division One strugglers Wormley Rovers 4-2. A much closer encounter at Bovingdon though where Oxhey Jets and the home side were goalless at the end of 90 minutes normal time and 30 minutes extra time. In the penalty shoot out Jets eventually edged through 8-7. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana"><H4>Weekend Review for the 23rd March 2002</H4>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>  Bank Holiday May Day Monday will see an all Watford Aubrey Cup Final clash at Harefield between Oxhey Jets and Sun Postal Sports.</P>
<P>After crushing Sandridge Rovers in the League last week, Oxhey Jets found the Rovers much tougher opposition in this afternoon’s Cup Semi-Final clash. Jets won through in the end by 2-1 to experience their first ever Aubrey Cup Final.</P>
<P>By comparison Sun Postal Sports could almost claim rights to the trophy having been finalists on no fewer than eight occasions. Their 2-0 home victory over Metropolitan Police Bushey followed the form book and denied the Police a second final appearance.</P>
<P>In the League, Bovingdon increased the pressure on the title favourites with a 3-0 home win over relegation threatened Croxley Guild. Elliott Star ended London Lions slim hopes of the title with a vital 1-0 home victory which keeps alive their chances of avoiding the drop although they remain three points below the safety line. Hatfield Town appear to be destined for a rapid return to Division One as they lost 5-1 at home against Chipperfield Corinthians. The days remaining clash saw Wormley Rovers win 2-0 at St Peters in a mid-table game.</P>
<P>In Division One Old Parmiterians took over top spot following a 1-0 home win against Standon &amp; Puckeridge. Hadley still remain favourites to take the title though and they recorded a 6-0 home win over Mill End Sports to move into second spot and with four games in hand on the leaders. Morning leaders Bushey Rangers dropped to third following the postponement of their match at Benington. Evergreen beat The Cheshunt Club 3-0 in a mid-table battle.</P>
<P>The first match in the Chairman’s Cup took place with Premier Division Bedmond Sports picking up three points at Division One Lemsford. The final score, 3-1.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana"><H4> Weekend Review for the 16th March 2002</H4>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>  Another twist in the battle for the Premier Division title as Bedmond fell to a surprise defeat at relegation threatened Cuffley, 1-0, whilst Sun Postal Sports took three valuable home points with a 2-0 win over St Peters who have upset several of the top sides in recent weeks. Sun now return to the top with a two point advantage over Bedmond and with two games in hand. London Lions challenge seems to have died as they lost 4-0 at home against Bovingdon who leapfrog them to move into third spot. Don’t rule out reigning Champions Oxhey Jets holding on to their title though as they crushed Sandridge Rovers 4-0 in a rehearsal for next weekends Aubrey Cup semi-final encounter. The situation at the bottom now looks dire for the bottom three. Hatfield Town went down 5-3 at Metropolitan Police Bushey and remain rooted to the bottom. Croxley Guild lost 3-1 at home against Wormley Rovers and, despite having games in hand are only a point ahead of Hatfield. Elliott Star, Centenary Trophy Finalists, lost 3-1 at Chipperfield Corinthians and are now two points ahead of Guild but six points away from safety.</P>
<P>In Division One Bushey Rangers moved two points clear of second placed Hadley thanks to a 0-0 draw at Standon &amp; Puckeridge. Hadley yet again postponed on their Brickfield Lane ground and now have three matches in hand on Rangers. Old Parmiterians closed to within two points of the second placed team with a 2-0 home success over Sarratt. The top three have now mathematically earned promotion. The afternoon’s remaining game saw end-of-season form side, Kimpton Rovers, beat Mill End Sports 5-3. Earlier Benington’s clash with The Cheshunt Club also fell victim to the damp conditions of the week. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana"><H4>Weekend Review for the 9th March 2002</H4>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>  Sandridge Rovers hopes of a place in the Cherry Red Books sponsored Capital Counties Feeder Leagues’ Trophy were literally blown away ay Pitstone &amp; Ivinghoe. With a strong cross wind blowing for most of the game good football was impossible. Neither side had a decent attempt on goal during the whole 120 minutes of normal and extra time stalemate. For the first 90 minutes Rovers had marginally the better possession and positional superiority. That situation switched around in extra time where the home side looked the more likely to break the deadlock. Penalties duly arrived and both sides had the second of their allotted five saved. On to sudden death and Rovers fired theirs way over the bar whilst Pitstone kept their cool and slotted home for their third successive penalty shootout victory in the competition.</P>
<P>Little movement in the League as all the main contenders won – with the exception of Oxhey Jets that is. Bedmond Sports remain top of the Premier Division with a 1-0 result at Chipperfield Corinthians. Sun Postal Sports got back on track with a 6-3 home win over relegation threatened Cuffley. London Lions remain third thanks to a 1-0 home win against Metropolitan Police Bushey. Bovingdon are now fourth as they thumped Jekyll and Hyde club Elliott Star 5-0 at Pursley. St Peters pulled off the surprise result of the day winning 2-1 at Oxhey Jets to move seven points clear of the relegation zone. The basement battle between Hatfield Town and Croxley Guild was abandoned after 15 minutes due to high winds at Birchwood.</P>
<P>In Division One Bushey Rangers hold on to top spot thanks to a 2-0 home win against The Cheshunt Club whose own promotion hopes are fading fast. Hadley remain second following a 1-0 home win over Standon &amp; Puckeridge. Old Parmiterians strengthened their grip on third spot with a 3-0 home win over lowly Welwyn. Newcomers Lemsford finished their first League campaign with a 5-0 victory at Benington and currently they occupy fourth spot. North Mymms were thumped 5-0 at home by fast improving Kimpton Rovers for whom the end of the season seems to be coming too soon. In the final game of the afternoon bottom placed Sarratt were humbled 7-0 by Evergreen.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana"><H4> Weekend Review for the 2nd March 2002</H4>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>  A tremendous weekend for Borehamwood based Elliott Star. Despite struggling against relegation in the Premier Division, they dumped Spartan-South Midlands League leaders Greenacres Hemel out of the Herts Senior Centenary Trophy to ensure an all County League final in early April. The 2-1 setback was only the Hemel Hempstead sides second defeat all season.</P>
<P>In the Aubrey Cup Quarter Final, Oxhey Jets kept alive their hopes of a second Cup Final appearance this term with a 3-0 victory at Division One promotion hopefuls Hadley. They’ll now play Sandridge Rovers in the Semi Finals later this month.</P>
<P>In the Premier Division the top match of the day saw morning leaders Sun Postal Sports visit second placed Bedmond Sports. By the end of the afternoon the two teams had exchanged places thanks to Bedmond’s 2-1 success. London Lions and Bovingdon failed to make up any ground. Lions lost 1-0 in the home match against Wormley Rovers – the match switched to Wormley due to the condition of the Copthall pitch. Meanwhile Bovingdon lost 2-1 at home to relegation threatened St Peters. Sandridge Rovers warmed up for their Cherry Red Trophy semi final next week with a 5-0 thrashing of bottom side Hatfield Town at Birchwood. In the final Premier Division game of the day, Metropolitan Police Bushey ended a disastrous run with a 2-0 victory at Cuffley. The result lifts the Police out of the bottom three.</P>
<P>Bushey Rangers took over top spot in Division One, a 4-0 win at Welwyn coupled with Hadley’s league inactivity giving Rangers a one point lead having played two games more. Old Parmiterians moved into third spot with a 3-1 success at Kimpton Rovers. They now lead Lemsford by three points following the newcomers 7-1 drubbing of The Cheshunt Club. The result sees Cheshunt drop from third to fifth – on goal difference. North Mymms strengthened their hold on sixth place with a 2-0 home win over Evergreen.</P>
<P>Finally, worthy of a mention, the League’s last 100% record for the season fell. Old Parmiterians Reserves beat London Lions Reserves in a thrilling match by 3-2. The disappointment for Lions that not only did their record go but Parmiterians took over leadership of the division. However, the Londoners do have three games in hand.</P>

<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;Herts Senior Centenary Trophy semi-final day saw reigning County League Champions Oxhey Jets move through to the Final of the competition for</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;the first time in the club’s history. Entertaining the side putting up the strongest challenge to claim their League crown, Sun Postal Sports, the</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Jets edged home 1-0. The second semi between Elliott Star and Spartan-South Midlands side Greenacres Hemel was postponed due to an unfit</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;pitch.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;In the League the second and third placed teams, Bedmond Sports and London Lions, fought out a 3-3 draw. A point not really enough for either</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;side with other title contenders having games in hand. Bovingdon rekindled their own challenge with a 3-0 victory at Wormley Rovers. They remain</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;in fifth spot behind Oxhey on goal difference. The real excitement of the day was at the foot of the table. Croxley Guild climbed off the bottom</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;with a 2-1 home win over Metropolitan Police Bushey. The win, Guild’s first at home in the League this season, drags the Police down into the</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;bottom three. Hatfield Town now occupy last place after losing 2-1 at home against Cuffley. For Cuffley the result lifts them from 11th to 8th. St</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Peters 3-1 win at Chipperfield Corinthians lifts them out of the relegation places.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;In Division One Hadley maintained their lead at the top with a close fought 3-2 win at Evergreen. Bushey Rangers maintained the pressure on them</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;with a 6-0 home success against mid-table North Mymms. The Cheshunt Club held on to the third promotion spot with a 4-3 victory at lowly</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Welwyn. The pressure is clearly on them though as Old Parmiterians won 4-0 at home against Benington ensuring that even the goal difference gap</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;narrowed and the Garston outfit have two games in hand. The two remaining games – mid table clashes – produced predictable draws, each one a</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;piece between Kimpton Rovers and Lemsford and Mill End Sports and Standon &amp; Puckeridge.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Verdana">Weekend Review for the 16th February 2002</B></FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;Yet another change of leadership in the Premier Division title race as three of the top five lost whilst at the foot of the table the battle for survival</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;hotted up.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;Sun Postal Sports ensured that for the second weekend running there was a top versus bottom match as their 4-1 success at Croxley Guild put</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;the hosts to the bottom whilst victory for Sun moves them back to the top three points clear of their nearest challengers. Last weekends leaders</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Bedmond surprisingly lost 1-0 at Metropolitan Police Bushey who have been struggling for points in recent weeks despite success in the Cup. So,</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Bedmond slip to second whilst the Police move a couple of points clear of the relegation places. The &quot;big match&quot; of the day was at Copthall where</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;London Lions had the chance to go top and complete a double over reigning champions Oxhey Jets. It didn’t work out for them though as the Jets</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;exacted revenge with a 2-1 success. The result leaves Lions third and Jets fourth but the gap between the two is now just a point. The shock</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;result of the day was Cuffley’s 2-1 victory at fifth placed Bovingdon. Just 14 days ago Cuffley were hammered out of sight 11-0 at Elliott Star but</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;this latest result lifts them out of the bottom three. Replacing them in the drop zone are St Peters despite managing a point in a 1-1 home draw</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;with Sandridge Rovers. Off the bottom, but still in the relegation area are Hatfield Town. They kept their hopes of staying up alive with a 6-4 win</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;at Elliott Star. So, strangely, the bottom three spaces are occupied by the three promoted clubs from last season. In the days remaining game</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Chipperfield Corinthians won 3-2 at Wormley Rovers to move up to sixth place.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;The Division One leaders Hadley were involved in Herts Intermediate Cup action – losing 1-0 after extra time to Bishops Stortford Swifts. Bushey</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Rangers took advantage to close the gap at the top to just two points following a 5-4 home win against Lemsford, who remain fifth. The Cheshunt</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Club wasted the chance of establishing themselves in third spot surprisingly losing 6-3 at home against mid table Kimpton Rovers. North Mymms</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;beat Standon &amp; Puckeridge 4-2 in an all mid table clash whilst struggling Benington kept their noses in front of the bottom two thanks to a 1-1</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;draw at Evergreen. The bottom two met at Sarratt where the home side picked up their first point for several weeks with a 1-1 draw against</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Welwyn.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;There’ll be no County League sides in the Intermediate Cup Final as Oxhey Jets Reserves lost out 4-1 to Berkhamsted Reserves in the other</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;semi-final tie.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;London Lions Reserves claimed the last place in the Reserve Cup Semi-Finals with a 2-1 victory at Old Parmiterians Reserves. They’ll now visit</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Wormley Rovers Reserves.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana"><P>&nbsp;<B>Weekend Review for the 9th February 2002</B></FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;Who needs the expense of the F.A. Premiership for a tense, close and exciting championship battle? Football fans should come down and have a</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;look at the fare available for free in the County League. Three teams now share the leadership of the Premier Division and those holding positions</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;four and five certainly can’t be ruled out of the title fight.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Bedmond Sports &amp; Social climbed to the pinacle thanks to a 3-1 home victory over Hatfield Town, who in the process slipped into bottom spot.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Just a goal behind come London Lions, whose match with Elliott Star was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch, and Sun Postal Sports who drew</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;1-1 with fifth placed Bovingdon. Reigning champions Oxhey Jets hold fourth spot four points below the joint leaders but with games in hand. Who’ll</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;win the title this year? That’s harder to predict than the F.A. Premiership.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;The remaining nine clubs are fighting to avoid relegation with a bad run likely to drop any team in the mire. Cherry Red Books Trophy and Aubrey</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Cup semi-finalists Sandridge Roverseased their worries with a 5-4 win at Chipperfield Corinthians. Cuffley and Croxley Guild shared the points in a</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;0-0 draw which leaves both in the bottom three. Oxhey Jets v Wormley Rovers and St Peters v Metropolitan Police Bushey both fell victim to the</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;weather.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;In Division One the top five all won. Hadley maintained their championship stranglehold with a 4-2 win at Kimpton Rovers to retain a five point</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;advantage. Bushey Rangers won 1-0 at Evergreen to hold second and The Cheshunt Club beat North Mymms 6-2 at home to slightly extend their</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;goal difference advantage in third over fourth placed Old Parmiterians. Parmiterians beat Mill End Sports 5-2 at home. Lemsford are fifth, just a</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;point behind the pair but having played three more games. They won an eight goal match at bottom of the table Sarratt 5-3.</FONT> </P>

<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;After the near total washout on Saturday 26th January it came as a welcome relief to discover that high winds on Friday and Saturday has blown</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;dry the rains of earlier in the week. A few games on the more vulnerable grounds did fall victim but most went ahead.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;In the Aubrey Cup Quarter Finals Sandridge exacted revenge for last term’s semi-final defeat by dumping out Hatfield Town 7-0. Sun Postal Sports</FONT> <BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;In The Reserve Cup Oxhey Jets and Bedmond finally got to meet each other and the outcome was a continuance of Jets amazing 100% record this</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;season – 2-0 the score line.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;In the Herts Intermediate Cup Hadley finally found a pitch dry enough to take on London Lions Reserves and scrapped through to the competitions</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;semi final stage 1-0.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;In League action Lions first team re-took the Premier Division lead following a 6-1 away win at now bottom Croxley Guild. Bedmond and Bovingdon</FONT> <BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;Sandridge Rovers became the League’s last representatives in this season’s Cherry Red Book sponsored Capital Counties Feeder Leagues’ Trophy. A</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;2-1 victory over the League Champions Oxhey Jets giving them revenge for defeat by the same opponents in last year’s competition. Rovers had</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;the better of the first half and went in with a 1-0 lead. When they scored a second direct from a corner midway through the second half the tie</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;looked over but Jets made a fight of it pulling a goal back with around 15 minutes left and Rovers lived on their nerve ends until the final whistle.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;They reckon they can go all the way in their lucky all white cup strip, lets hope they do.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;&quot;It’s a funny old game&quot; they say and never was that more true than at Birchwood. Hatfield Town, not a point so far this season from seven home</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;matches, versus London Lions, with the division’s best away record – only one defeat – second in the table and looking to return to the top. The</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;final result? 2-1 to Town. Enough to lift Hatfield off the bottom (on goals scored) above Croxley Guild. The Guild picked up a useful away point at</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Wormley Rovers in a 2-2 draw. Chipperfield Corinthians continued there improvement picking up all three points at Metropolitan Police Bushey with</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;a 2-0 victory. The result lifts Corinthians to the heady heights of sixth. Sun Postal Sports remain top despite their home match with Cuffley being</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;abandoned in the 65th minute following a serious injury to a Sun player. The home side were leading 1-0.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;After their marathon tie with Flamstead, Bushey Rangers bowed out of the Herts Intermediate Cup 3-1 at home against Oxhey Jets Reserves. Jets</FONT> <BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana"><P>&nbsp;<B>Weekend Review for the 12th January 2002</B></FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;A great day in the Herts Senior Centenary Trophy for County League sides with both Elliott Star and Oxhey Jets knocking out rival league</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;opposition. Elliott Star had by far the toughest task on paper as they faced the daunting prospect of visiting the reigning champions Tring Athletic</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;who hadn’t lost a tie in the competition for three seasons. Last weekends humiliating defeat at Eton Manor in the Cherry Red Books Trophy was</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;hardly the ideal warm up. So a 3-1 victory must rank as the highlight of the Quarter Finals. Oxhey Jets prospects against Leverstock Green seemed</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;better. The visitors occupied ninth place (out of twenty) in Spartan-South Midlands Division One and would provide a good test of Jets prospects</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;if they succeed in winning promotion to the same league at the end of the season. Leverstock took the lead in the opening 15 minutes and had</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;the better of the exchanges in the opening half hour. Steadily Jets got back into the game but as the second half wore on it looked increasingly as</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;if the visitor’s solitary goal would be enough. Then with around five minutes left a Leverstock defender handled on the line and Hallum converted</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;the penalty, his shot hitting the post on its way in. The second period of extra time saw the most decisive break of the entire match and Page</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;coolly slotted past the visitors’ keeper to dump Leverstock out of the competition. The third tie that featured County League sides was Sun Postal</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Sports v Bovingdon. A close match saw Sun join Elliott and Oxhey in the Semi-Finals.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;In the League, London Lions were unable to take advantage of the rest of the top five’s inactivity being held 2-2 at Sandridge Rovers. Wormley</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Rovers moved themselves to the top of the group of nine fighting to avoid the drop spots with a 2-0 success at bottom club Hatfield Town. Seven</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;defeats in seven home League games have shackled Town to the bottom and they need a dramatic turnaround in form if they are to avoid an</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;instant return to Division One. Chipperfield Corinthians improved their prospects with a 5-0 home win against Croxley Guild. The result leaves</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Croxley precariously placed just above Hatfield. After their backroom upheavals Cuffley are now making a real fight to hold onto their Premier</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Division spot and a 4-0 victory over St Peters did them no harm at all. They’re still third bottom but only a point adrift of a group of three clubs.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;In Division One none of the top three were in League action. Hadley’s game was postponed whilst Bushey Rangers were involved in cup action and</FONT> <BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&amp; Puckeridge. Lemsford hold fifth spot thanks to a 1-0 win at Welwyn and Mill End Sports are sixth by virtue of a 3-1 home win against North</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Mymms. In the battle of the bottom two Benington took the honours with a 3-2 success at Sarratt. The result lifts Benington above Welwyn and</FONT> <BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;undoubtedly Oxhey Jets v Sun Postal Sports. Sun having reached the top last weekend were anxious to hold on to it whilst Oxhey as reigning</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Champions needed to do a &quot;Manchester United&quot; and prove they don’t plan to give up their title easily. The final result, 2-0 to Oxhey Jets. They</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;remain in fourth spot and the Sun remain top. However the Watford’s sides lead is now only on goal difference as London Lions drew 2-2 at home</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;against Chipperfield Corinthians. That’s eight draws in sixteen League matches for Corinthians the League’s draw specialists. Bedmond retained</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;third spot but closed the gap to just two points following a 2-1 win at Wormley Rovers. The final Premier Division game saw Sandridge Rovers beat</FONT> <BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;In Division One, Hadley maintained top spot with a hard fought 3-2 home win against The Cheshunt Club. Bushey Rangers kept the pressure on</FONT> <BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;Aubrey Cup 2nd Round day saw one shock and also - in line with recent tradition - the holders making their exit. The shock result came at Croxley</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;where the Guild were thrashed at home by Division One outfit Bushey Rangers - the final score 6-2. Holders Elliott Star tumbled 3-2 at home</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;against fellow Premier Division side Sandridge Rovers. Runners up Hatfield Town scraped through 3-2 on penalties after the match ended 3-3</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;following extra time. Bedmond completed the most miserable of hattricks, going down 3-1 to reigning Premier Division champions Oxhey Jets -</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;that's three cup competition exits in three weeks. Sun Postal Sports got back into winning ways and showed the gulf in class between the top end</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;of the Premier Division and the middle of Division One trouncing Kimpton Rovers on their own patch 8-0. Division One leaders Hadley joined Bushey</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Rangers in the Quarter Finals with a 7-0 demolishion of Sarratt. Cuffley took local rivals Wormley Rovers to extra time but crumbled in the extra</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;period to lose 4-1 whilst in the final tie of the afternoon Metropolitan Police Bushey comfortably beat Division One outfit North Mymms 5-2 to book</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;their place in the last eight. The Quarter Finals line up as follows:- Sandridge Rovers v Hatfield Town; Sun Postal Sports v Wormley Rovers; Bushey</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Rangers v Met Police Bushey; and Hadley v Oxhey Jets.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;In the League, Bovingdon went top thanks to a 7-0 win at St Peters in the afternoon's only Premier Division encounter.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Three games were played in Division One. Lemsford moved up to fourth following a 1-0 home win against Benington whilst Old Parmiterians</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;improved their promotion prospects with a 1-0 win at Evergreen and Mill End recorded a 4-1 away success at Standon &amp; Puckeridge. The</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;afternoon's other scheduled game between The Cheshunt Club and Welwyn had to be called off when demands on the Hertfordshire constabulary</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;took away the majority of the Welwyn side.</FONT> </P>

<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;Shock result of the day was Hatfield Town's 3-1 victory at Sun Postal Sports. Sun had the opportunity of returning to the top of the Premier</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Division and on paper looked certs to pick up three points against a struggling Hatfield outfit. It didn't turn out that way though and Town returned</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;home with a much needed victory. Oxhey Jets might also have deposed London Lions at the top but a 3-2 defeat at Bovingdon put paid to their</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;hopes. So Lions remain top despite being in Herts Centenary Trophy action. Not a happy afternoon for them though, as St peters - visitors to</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Copthall Stadium held them to 1-1 at full time and 3-3 at the end of extra time and them dumped them out of the Trophy 8-7 on penalties.</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Elsewhere in the Premier Division, Elliott Star earned a much needed home three points with a 2-1 win against Wormley Rovers. Meanwhile in the</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Centenary Trophy Chipperfield lost 4-0 at home against former County Leaguers Kings Langley and Cuffley lost 3-2 at home to another former</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;County League side, Colney Heath. Met Police beat fellow County League side Bedmond 2-1 - Bedmond's second cup exit in eight days - and</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Sandridge Rovers hammered Croxley Guild 6-0. In Division One two games fell victim to Friday nights rain - Hadley v Evergreen and Sarratt v</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Benington. In the Division's game of the day Bushey Rangers took advantage of Hadley's inactivity to close the gap at the top to two points with a</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;3-2 win at third placed Old Parmiterians. Mill End and Kimpton Rovers shared eight goals in the highest scoring senior game of the day and Standon</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&amp; Puckeridge and Lemsford also shared the points with two goals a piece. Congratulations to Welwyn. They beat North Mymms 2-0 to record their</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;first League victory of the season at the eleventh attempt. They are now just a point adrift of Sarratt and Benington at the foot of the table.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana"><P>&nbsp;<B>Weekend Review - Saturday 20th October 2001</B></FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;Sun Postal Sports encountered their worst afternoon of the season. A 2-0 defeat in the Cherry Red Books Trophy at Netherne Village has cost</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;them a bumper pay day. The winners of the tie host Essex Senior League leaders Enfield Town in the next round. Enfield, formed by a group of</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;"true" Enfield supporters have regularly been drawing crowds of 300-400 for away games. To compound Sun's misery they lost top spot in the</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Premier Division as London Lions recovered from last weekends set back to beat newboys St Peters 3-1 at Copthall. Also making early exits from</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;the Cherry Red competition were Cuffley, mauled 8-1 at home by current holders Tring Athletic, and Bedmond, the 1999-2000 finalists beaten 2-1</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;at home by Frenford Senior. Wormley Rovers carry the League flag into the next round though following their 3-0 victory at Spartan-South</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Midlands League Winslow United. In the League, Oxhey Jets closed in on the top two with a 4-2 home victory over struggling Hatfield Town. There</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;were also victories for Croxley Guild, Bovingdon and Met Police. In Division One Hadley extended their lead with a 2-0 home result against</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;basement club Welwyn. Evergreen and North Mymms shared the points in a goalless draw. In the Herts Intermediate Cup, Senior sides Lemsford,</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Benington, Bushey Rangers, The Cheshunt Club, Mill End Sports and Old Parmiterians all progressed to the second round whilst Kimpton Rovers and</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Sarratt were first round casualties.</FONT> <BR>
