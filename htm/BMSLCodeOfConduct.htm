<B><U><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Code of Conduct for Coaches</P>
</B></U></FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Coaches are key to the establishment of ethics in football. Their concept of ethics and their attitude directly affects the behaviour of players under their supervision. Coaches are, therefore, expected to pay particular care to the moral aspect of their conduct.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Coaches have to be aware that almost all of their everyday decisions and choices of actions, as well as strategic targets, have ethical implications.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is natural that winning constitutes a basic concern for coaches. This code is not intended to conflict with that. However, the code calls for coaches to disassociate themselves from a &quot;win-at-all-costs&quot; attitude.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Increased responsibility is requested from coaches involved in coaching young people. The health, safety, welfare and moral education of young people are a first priority, before the achievement or the reputation of the club, school, coach or parent.</P>
