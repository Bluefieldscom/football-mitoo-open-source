sees them fourth whilst Whitewebbs 6-0 home thrashing of North Mymms puts 
them up to fifth. The second, third fourth and fifth placed teams all have 
23 points with just goal difference separating them.  And finally, there is
hope at the foot of the table.  Buntingford Town salvaged a home point against
Kimpton Rovers.  Trailing 1-0 with 5 minutes left, the League&#8217;s new boys
unearthed their own Wayne Rooney in the shape of 17 year old Luke Tyler. 
The teenager struck a screaming 20 yard drive into the top of the net for 
 1-1 and with just about the last kick might have grabbed Town&#8217;s first win 
 but his effort went just wide.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="+1"><b>

		Sun  Postal Sports overcame the tragic midweek death of their Chairman,
Frank Woolner, who passed away from a heart attack, to maintain top spot
and their quest for the Premier Division title.  A visit to bottom of the
table Bedmond Sports could have proved a tricky challenge but Sun ran out
3-1 winners with goals from Johnson, Coldrake and Shannon.  Bedmond&#8217;s only
reply came from Atkins.  Reigning champions Oxhey Jets gave early season
contenders Sandridge Rovers notice that they won&#8217;t be giving up their title
easily.  Goals from Page (2), Beadle and Holdom earned the Jets three away
points and inflicted only Rovers second home defeat of the season.  Fryer

result lifting the visitors  to third.  Wormley Rovers maintained their mid

action.  London Lions earned the biggest win of the day beating AFC Guildford

 was also notable.  Luxford, Richards and Trindie earned the surprise victory.
  The performances of the rest of the League&#8217;s sides were less impressive.
  Chipperfield Corinthians, Croxley Guild and Hadley all made exits without
 scoring whilst Elliott Star did manage a Jones goal at White Ensign however,
 the home side netted four.<br>
<br>
   Most of the Division One sides were in Herts Intermediate Cup action.
 Two matches did take place though and at Buntingford Town, Lemsford&#8217;s narrow
 2-1 victory over the bottom side was enough to put them back on top a point
 clear of Codicote.  A brace from Sweetman earning the valuable three points.

 up to third spot.   		</font></p>

1-1.   Stuart Leader struck for Bovingdon.  Elliott Star and Wormley Rovers
provided  the division&#8217;s highest scoring match of the afternoon sharing the

scored for the Brickfield  Lane side but Glenister, Walker and Fox ensured
Rangers left happy.  Strugglers  Croxley Guild and Old Parmiterians fought

as they went down 2-1 at home to  Cuffley.  Butt netted for the home side
but a Luxford brace gave the Zeppelins  all three points.<br>

 leaders&#8217; Sun Postal Sports league inactivity, due to a cup commitment, to
 take over top spot in the Premier Division for the first time this season.
 A trip to Metropolitan Police Bushey is never predictable and even though
 the home side have started the season badly they are always capable of upsetting
 the formbook. Bovingdon though knuckled down to their task and in the end
 were comfortable 3-1 winners. The visitors goals coming from Mark Swales
and a brace from Mark Fryer whilst Thackeray hit the lone reply for the Police.

 ended goalless as Standon &amp; Puckeridge and Whitewebbs shared the points.

<font face="Verdana" size="2">For the second weekend running Sun Postal Sports
 took advantage of their nearest rivals league inactivity to open a four
point  lead at the top of the Premier Division. Sun who are undertaking a
&amp;pound;1/2million  facelift of their Bellmount Wood Avenue facilities
are playing most of their  matches away from home but it hasn&#8217;t prevented
the Watford based club pushing  towards achieving their pyramid promotion
aspirations. Lowly St Albans based  St Peters provided little opposition
to the Sun who collected three away points and a 4-1 result. Journeyman Darren
Seabrook, Mark Congalton, Paul Hayes and Richard Johnson scored for Sun with
an own goal the reply for Saints.  Reigning champions Oxhey Jets are finding

Glenister and Robson netting Rangers efforts. The point wasn&#8217;t enough to
lift Bedmond off the bottom though with their goal difference the worst of
four clubs vying for the dubious honour.</font><br>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">In Division One Lemsford closed the gap to just
a point on leaders Standon &amp; Puckeridge with a 2-0 home win against Allenburys
Sports. Whitewebbs remain close behind following a 3-0 win at Evergreen.

beating Premier Division Metropolitan Police Bushey 2-0 &#8211; Watson and Padmore

 the fact that League leaders London Lions were not in action to leapfrog
them and takeover top spot. Struggling Metropolitan Police Bushey provided
little opposition as goals from Chris Eldridge, Richard Johnson (2) and Paul
Haynes secured a 4-1 win and three away points with only Thackerly replying

 a tight encounter with St Albans based St Peters. Goals from Fryer and Andrews

 dished out a 6-1 drubbing courtesy of a brace from Wade and one a piece
from  Bone, Charles, Obeney and Syrett. Bedmond&#8217;s only reward a Noble strike.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">London Lions celebrated their first match
 at their new Rowley Lane, Barnet home with a 2-0 victory over St Peters
which  took them back to the top of the Premier Division. Gold and Skone
netted for the home side. Midweek leaders and reigning Champions Oxhey Jets
went down to a 3-1 defeat away to a resurgent Cuffley. Crump, Purdy and Bott
did the damage with Jets only reply from Danslow. Cuffley leap frog them
and move into third spot. Watford based Sun Postal Sports are second but
had to settle for a share of the points with a 1-1 local derby draw against
newly promoted Old Parmiterians - Seabrook got Sun's goal with Lee replying.
The other two promoted sides did well, Hadley victorious 1-0 on their home
patch against Bovingdon thanks to a Gruar strike and Bushey Rangers recording
an impressive 4-0 away success at Croxley Guild - Swaysland, Dinnen, Tobin
and an own goal making up their tally. Metropolitan Police Bushey earned
their first win of the season with a 4-3 home triumph against Sandridge Rovers.
Two a piece for the home side from Thackley and Shorto with Cutmore and a
brace from Pinkham the reply for Rovers. The biggest surprise of the season
so far is that Bedmond Sports &amp; Social currently occupy bottom spot.
One of last season's championship contenders, they lost their fourth game
of five 2-0 at home versus Chipperfield Corinthians for whom Tyson and Elton
did the damage. Plenty of goals in the Premier Division's remaining game
where Wormley Rovers and Elliott Star shared six goals and the points. Wade
with two and Obeney struck for the home side. Murphy, Jones and Wicks got
Stars efforts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Division One, surprise leaders Standon
 &amp; Puckeridge maintained their good start with a 5-1 victory against
basement  club Sarratt. A Miles hatrick and one each from Davis and Ridley
made up the visitors tally the only reply from Barnwell. Pre-season promotion
favourites  Lemsford remain hot on their heels after a midweek setback. Goals
from Draper,  Pugh, Pickett and Orchard gave them an impressive 4-1 win at
relegated Hatfield  Town for whom Chang netted a consolation. This pair are
three points ahead  of the chasing pack which is led by newcomers Hinton
who maintained their  unbeaten record with a 1-1 home draw against North
Mymms - Brown with the  home goal and Vokes replying for the visitors.</font><br>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Elsewhere Mill End Sports, Whitewebbs and Allenburys
 Sports all recorded impressive away victories. Mill End defeating The Cheshunt
 Club 6-4; Whitewebbs beating Buntingford Town 4-1 and Allenburys successful
 at Kimpton Rovers by a similar score. In the days remaining game Codicote

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another weird and wonderful midweek with
 some quirky results. Oxhey Jets moved to the top with a 2-0 victory over
out of sorts Bedmond Sports. Weekend leaders London Lions slipped to a surprise
 2-1 defeat at St Peters for whom the result kick started the season. Sun
Postal Sports earned a valuable three points away at Sandridge Rovers, the
score 1-0. Bovingdon joined a group of three other clubs at the top on nine
points virtue of a 2-1 home win against Old Parmiterians. Bushey Rangers
rediscovered their midweek form to beat a struggling Metropolitan Police
Bushey 3-0. The divisions other newcomers, Hadley recorded their first victory
winning 2-1 at Elliott Star. Elsewhere Chipperfield Corinthians won 1-0 at
home against Croxley Guild and Cuffley and Wormley Rovers shared the points
in a goalless draw.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Division One Standon &amp; Puckeridge
 took over top spot with a 2-0 away success at Buntingford Town. Previous
leaders Lemsford fell to a surprise defeat 3-1 at newcomers Allenburys Sports.
Hinton beat The Cheshunt Club 5-0 but the shock result of Wednesday evening
was Codicote&#8217;s 9-0 demolition of Kimpton Rovers who were amongst the early
season pacesetters. Whitewebbs recorded a useful 4-2 away success at North
Mymms while the previous night Evergreen had tasted away success beating
Mill End Sports 3-0. The remaining game between Hatfield Town and Sarratt
was cancelled when the visitors discovered they couldn&#8217;t get a team to Hatfield.</font></p>

Report</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Three games in &#8211; for most clubs &#8211; and London
 Lions sit on top of the Premier Division table with the only 100% record
in the division. A 1-0 victory ay Bedmond Sports was enogh to see the Lions
3 points clear of their nearest rivals. Sandridge Rovers record fell with
a 4-2 setback at Bovingdon whilst last seasons runners-up, Sun Postal Sport
 ended their perfect start with a 2-1 defeat at Elliott Star. It was a case
 of after the Lord Mayors Show for Bushey Rangers who lost 3-1 at home to
Croxley Guild following their midweek beating of the League Champions. Oxhey
Jets recovered from their midweek setback to record a 3-1 home win over Wormley
 Rovers. Chipperfield Corinthians got their first win with a 3-2 victory
against  promoted Hadley whilst Cuffley scored three without reply against
another  of the promoted clubs, Old Parmiterians. Finally, St Peters and
Metropolitan  Police Bushey each picked up their first point of the season
after a 3-3 draw at Toulmin Drive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Division One Standon &amp; Puckeridge
 remain unbeaten but lost their perfect record being held 1-1 at home by
new  club Hinton. Kimpton Rovers too lost their 100% record following a 3-3
home  draw against The Cheshunt Club. Those result left Lemsford as the only
three  wins out of three team as they overcame Codicote 2-1 at home to take
top spot in the Division. Hatfield Town recovered from their midweek defeat
to beat North Mymms 6-2 away in the local derby. Their midweek conquerors,
Evergreen  were held 1-1 by new club Buntingford Town &#8211; a welcome first point
for the  newcomers. Mill End Sports beat another of the new teams, Allenburys
Sports,  3-1 whilst Whitewebbs recovered from a midweek drubbing to beat
Sarratt 6-1  for their first points back in the League.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" color="#008080">Midweek 20th to 22nd August Round
 Up Report</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was a midweek of madness and mayhem in
 more ways than one. As one expects this time of the season, there were a
few surprise results, the biggest of which was Bushey Rangers 3-2 home win
over Champions Oxhey Jets. Does it spell a successful season for Rangers
on their return to the top flight? Only time will tell. Having had a convincing
win on the opening Saturday Elliott Star were well beaten by Sandridge Rovers
 who have made an excellent start to the campaign &#8211; the scoreline 4-1. London
 Lions too have got away to a good start and their 2-1 success at Wormley
Rovers cancelled out the home sides away win on the opening Saturday. Bovingdon
secured their first points of the season with a 2-0 win at Bedmond and Old
Parmiterians did the same at home against Chipperfield Corinthians &#8211; this
time the score 2-1. Sun Postal Sports maintained a 100% record with a 4-0
win at Croxley Guild. Cuffley&#8217;s 2-1 win at St Peters earned their first points
but left their hosts pointless after two matches. Finally in the Premier,
Hadley&#8217;s match with Metropolitan Police was abandoned after 65 minutes play
following an incident which saw two players ambulanced to hospital with suspected
broken legs. Hard luck on Hadley who had been leading 4-1 at the time of
the incident.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Division One Lemsford enhanced their
pre-season reputation as promotion candidates with a 7-2 home win over returning
Whitewebbs. A vastly different Whitewebbs though from the club thrown out
of the League 14 months ago and who hopefully will find their feet back in
the League. Kimpton Rovers are perhaps the surprise team, maintaining a 100%
record with a 2-0 home win against newcomers Buntingford Town. North Mymms
and The Cheshunt Club had played just 33 minutes when, with the score at
4-3 to the home club, mayhem broke out with fighting on the pitch and an
"invasion" by those watching. Despite red carding six players the referee
was left with little option but to abandon the game and now both clubs must
wait and see what punishment the County F.A. and League handout after such
unacceptable behaviour. Elsewhere, Standon &amp; Puckeridge also maintained
a 100% start with a 3-1 home success in the local derby against newboys Allenburys
Sports. Evergreen shocked Hatfield Town beating them 4-0 whilst Mill End
Sports recorded a similar success against Sarratt. Finally Codicote and Hinton
shared the points in a 1-1 draw and also shared having one player sent off
each.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the Premier Division reigning Champions
 Oxhey Jets got off to a good start in the defence of their title with a
3-1  victory at St Peters. Not such good news for the three promoted clubs
all  of whom got off to a losing start. Division One Champions Hadley lost
their  ?home? game against Bedmond Sports &amp; Social 2-1; their runners-up,
Bushey  Rangers, went down 1-0 at home against Premier Division runners-up
Sun Postal  Sports; and Old Parmiterians were hammered 5-1 at home by London
Lions. Elsewhere,  the biggest winning margin of the day came at Elliott
Star where the home  side hit Cuffley for six. Wormley Rovers picked up three
away points at Bovingdon  winning by the odd goal in five whilst Sandridge
Rovers were also successful  on their travels winning 1-0 at Chipperfield
Corinthians. In the other Premier  Division game, Croxley Guild beat Metropolitan
Police Bushey 2-1.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mixed results in Division One for the newboys.
 Allenburys Sports recorded an impressive 1-0 away win at Evergreen whilst
 Hinton also tasted early success with a 5-3 win at Sarratt. Not so good
though  for Buntingford Town ? beaten 2-1 at Lemsford or for Whitewebbs ?
hammered  5-1 at Kimpton Rovers. Returning Codicote did manage a share of
the spoils  with a 1-1 draw at North Mymms. Relegated Hatfield Town got off
to a great  start with a 5-1 victory at Mill End Sports whilst in the afternoon?s
remaining  game Standon &amp; Puckeridge recorded one of their best starts
ever with  a 6-1 home thumping of The Cheshunt Club.</font></p>
