Sit With Us', a history of Boston Town FC, was launched at the
Poachers' match with Boston United on 14 July. <br>
      <br>
Boston born journalist Simon Ashberry has written the book which charts
the Poachers' history from their foundation in 1964 when neighbours
Boston United dropped out of senior football and a group of supporters
formed their own club to keep semi pro football alive in the town. <br>
The book charts the many highlights in the club's history which include
championships in five different leagues, an FA Cup run which saw the
Poachers take on Barnsley, an FA Trophy giant killing against holders
Stafford and a Vase run to the brink of Wembley. <br>
The 200 page book which includes 50 or so archive photographs, is
priced at &pound;10. Copies can be obtained at the ground on matchdays
or ordered online at www.bostontownfc.co.uk . </span>

Bob Don-Duncan's side acquitted themselves well and United only took
charge of the match in the closing stages. Summer signing Danny Matson
fired the Poachers ahead with a 17th minute debut strike, and they
stayed in front until Gary Ellender hauled the Poachers on terms after
68 minutes. <br>

United went in front after 82 minutes through Matthew O'Halloran with
Simon Rusk sealing their victory in the dying seconds. </span>

      <td align="left" bgcolor="White"> <span class="pix13">A history
of Bugbrooke St Michaels FC, entitled 'A History of Football in
Bugbrooke' has recently been published. <br>
      <br>
The book charts the progress made by the Badgers since their formation
in 1929, with a mention of predecessor clubs in the village which set
the ball rolling over a century ago. <br>
      <br>
Club president John Curtis has compiled the book. With spells as
manager, general manager and chairman behind him he is eminently
qualified to do so, the publication also reveals that he was one of the
club's star graduates as a player, joining Northampton Town as a
professional on leaving school having played for Bugbrooke from the age
of 13! <br>
      <br>
The main feature of the book is an array of over 200 photographs,
including a stunning panoramic cover photograph of the village taken
from the air. Many of the club's highlights are recorded by cuttings
from the press of the day. <br>
      <br>
Bugbrooke St Michaels prides itself on being a 'community club' as
acknowledged by the award of the Community Clubs Charter Standard by
the Football Association in 2004. The success of its youth policy over
the years can be seen from the high number of players in photographs of
the senior teams in 2004 who also featured in photographs of the youth
teams a decade or so ago. <br>
      <br>
The book is available from Badgers secretary Roger Geary, 31
Kislingbury Road, Bugbrooke, Northampton NN7 3QG. Price is &pound;12.50
including postage and packing, cheques payable to Bugbrooke St Michaels
FC. </span>
