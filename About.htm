<b><i>"No thanks, we already have our own website"</i></b>  Many leagues use <i>football.mitoo</i> as well. The facility to automatically and instantly update league tables and grids on-line is really worth having. You'd be on the map with links pointing to both websites.
<BR><BR>
<i><b>"I hate computers and the internet!"</b></i> Get someone else on your league committee to try it.
<BR><BR>
<i><b>"Is it difficult to use?"</b></i> No. It's so easy there's no instruction book.
<BR><BR>
<i><b>"Who can see the referees' marks or player registration information?"</b></i> Only password holders can see sensitive information. Every league has its own database and password.
<BR><BR>
<i><b>"If I decide to give it a try, how long would it take to set up?"</b></i> On average, less than a couple of hours. We'd do most of it for you.
<BR><BR>
      <i><b>"Does it create a fixture list?"</b></i> No. You'd do that in the
      same way you've been doing for years. <i>football.mitoo</i> creates an unscheduled
      list and checks that you don't double book a team on any match day. It also
      monitors the sequence and frequency of team pairings.<BR>
      <BR>
<i><b>"Does it handle knockout competitions?"</b></i> Yes, with winning teams' names automatically promoted to the next round.
<BR><BR>
<i><b>"Can we have teams playing each other three or four times a season?"</b></i> Yes. Or only once a season, if you like.
<BR><BR>
<i><b>"If a team drops out during the season can we expunge their results?"</b></i> Yes. We'd do it for you and all results and marks would be saved in a Miscellaneous Division.
<BR><BR>
</span>
</td>
<td width="50%" valign="TOP"><span class="normal">
<i><b>"Can we have league tables with two points for a win?"</b></i> Yes, and goal average if you like.
<BR><BR>
      <i><b>"You've been going for eight seasons. Do you have any references?"</b></i>
      Yes. Please <a href="http://football.mitoo.co.uk/WhatUSay.cfm">click here</a>.
      <BR>
      <BR>
<i><b>"Will you put in our results for us?"</b></i> No. You are responsible for this. You can enter all your match day results in one go using email and batch input. It takes only seconds.
<BR><BR>
      <i><b>"If I change the name of a club will it appear with its new name everywhere
      on the website?"</b></i> Yes. <em>football.mitoo</em> utilises a fully relational
      database system. <BR>
      <BR>
<i><b>"Can a player have several suspensions a season and is the system sensitive to the date ranges?"</b></i> Yes.
<BR><BR>
<i><b>"Is it really free?"</b></i> Yes
<BR><BR>
<i><b>"How come I've never heard of football.mitoo?"</b></i> We do not advertise. Recommendations are by word of mouth.
<BR><BR>
<i><b>"Do you have a helpdesk?"</b></i> Yes. 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day. Users rarely call, however.
<BR><BR>
      <i><b>"Is it easy to add individual match reports?"</b></i> Yes. <br /><br />
<i><b>"Will it handle Assistant Referees appointments and marks too?"</b></i> Yes.
<BR><BR>
<i><b>"How does it handle an awarded game?"</b></i> Just one mouse click gives the points to the home or away team. The goals for & against remain unchanged.
<BR><BR>
      <i><b>"Our registered players and season's fixtures are already on a spreadsheet.
      Can we download from this?"</b></i> Yes <BR>
