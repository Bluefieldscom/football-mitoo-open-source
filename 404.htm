Through continuous improvements to the site, files are either replaced or dropped completely. If you have not visited the site for some time, links you may have, via favourites or direct links from other websites, may have become outdated.</p>
<p>
Please go to the main entry page <a href="http://www.football.mitoo.co.uk">here</a> - go to the pages you would normally access, and recreate your favourites.
</p>
<p>
If you are expecting to see results via another website (perhaps your club's site), please advise your webmaster that things have changed!
</p>
<p>
Once you have re-established your links, we hope that you will find the new system faster and more reliable.
