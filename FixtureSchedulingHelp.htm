  <span class="pix18">A new way to do Fixture Scheduling<BR>
  <BR>
  </span> <span class="pix13"> 1. Click on Unscheduled Matches and then click 
  on the Division code or Cup code for the chosen competition, the same as usual.<BR>
  <BR>
  2. Click on "click here" where it says "Please click here to change this fixture 
  date" in the heading.<BR>
  <BR>
  3. Click on "choose" where it says "Please choose the fixture date".<BR>
  <BR>
  4. You should get a small javascript calendar popping up. <span class="pix13boldred">If 
  you don't get this calendar - let me know immediately! See below...<BR>
  </span> <BR>
  5. Click on the date you require.<BR>
  Note: You can go to an earlier month by clicking on << , or to a later month 
  by clicking on >> in the calendar heading.<BR>
  <BR>
  6. Your chosen date will appear in the box above the Confirm button.<BR>
  When you are happy with this date, click on Confirm, otherwise repeat from step 
  3.<BR>
  <BR>
  7. You will get a list of Unscheduled Matches, the same as usual, but if any 
  of the teams are busy that day then their names will be crossed through and 
  you won't be able to tick the box next to these games.<BR>
  <BR>
  8. Tick the games you require and then click on the Add Group button.<BR>
  <BR>
  9. If all your choices were OK then the fixtures will be made and you will see 
  them on the MatchDay screen.<BR>
  <BR>
  10. At the first occurrence of a bad choice you will get a red warning message. 
  All prior choices will succeed.<BR>
  <BR>
  <BR>
  To add fixtures for another competition repeat from Step 1. <BR>
  The fixture date will remain the same until you change it so go to step 7 if 
  you want to keep the same fixture date.<BR>
