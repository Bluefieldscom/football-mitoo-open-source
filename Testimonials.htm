The task appeared to be daunting but they uploaded all of our existing data and the site was soon up and running.<br /><br />The learning curve for the changeover was not as steep as I had anticipated and the four people using the system - fixtures, registrations, referees and results - soon settled to using football.mitoo.<br /><br />Throughout the season it is inevitable that there will be problems with any system, but any that we have encountered have been speedily and efficiently dealt with by football.mitoo. I have been working with fixtures software for more than 25 years and football.mitoo is the most user friendly that I have used.&#8221;<br />&nbsp;')">
