<BR>
 <span class="pix13">It is several years since I changed my gas and electricity supplier for the 
  final time. I had previously changed to companies that claimed to have lower 
  prices but <strong>Telecom <em>plus</em> PLC</strong> are the cheapest supplier for domestic gas and electricity 
  throughout the UK. Wherever you live and however much you use, their energy 
  is the cheapest. If this company can't save you money on your Gas or Electricity 
  - I would like to hear from you.</span><BR>

<span class="pix18bold"><a href="https://www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk/store/elec.taf?exref=134701" target="_blank">UK's cheapest household electricity</a></span><BR>
<BR>
<span class="pix13">You will not find them recommended on comparison sites 
such as <em>uswitch</em> because <strong>Telecom <em>plus</em> PLC</strong> doesn't pay them a fee. <u>They get all 
their new business through recommendation and that is why I am telling you.</u> 
<strong>Telecom <em>plus</em> PLC</strong> saves money by putting all their bills into one envelope and 
they don't waste cash on advertising or sponsorship, which is why you probably have never heard of them.</span><BR>

<BR>
<span class="pix13">They provide landline and mobile telephone and 
  internet services too. These are all very cheap but they don't claim always 
  to be the cheapest on these because there is such a huge choice of tariffs which 
  are forever changing.</span><BR>

<span class="pix13">I was so impressed with <strong>Telecom <em>plus</em> PLC</strong> prices that 
I signed up to promote them. If you switch any of your services to <strong>Telecom <em>plus</em> PLC</strong> then I will earn a small commission which will help with the running costs 
of the <em>football.mitoo</em> website. If you prefer not to apply online then <a href="mailto:INSERT_EMAIL_HERE?subject=Telecom plus PLC enquiry">email me</a> 
with your name and address and I will arrange for an application form to be sent 
to you in the post. If you send them a recent bill they will tell you how much 
you are likely to save, so you can make sure it is worth changing and you are 
under no obligation whatsoever by returning the form.</span><BR>
