<font face="#Font_Face#" size="-1"><br />I've used various football administration packages over the past 30 years
or so but have found <em>football.mitoo</em> the most comprehensive to date. I had
to transfer both registrations and fixtures to <em>football.mitoo</em> at short notice
- and <font face="#Font_Face#" color="red" size="-1"><strong>the transition was much easier and better than I had anticipated.</strong></font> 
I'm convinced that Toolstation League clubs will benefit from the extra information
that will be made available to them - and also welcome the opportunity to
be able to provide that information much sooner than in the past. (August 24, 2006)<BR>

          are being made all the time. Convince Julian that any improvement would

I had little knowledge of <i>football.mitoo</i> until Julian spoke his piece about the system in July at the annual F.A. National Leagues Conference at Birmingham. Being an inquisitive person by nature I decided to follow up Julian’s offer to visit and view his Internet system.<BR>
 <BR>
Hellenic Football League records were maintained on various 'Excel' spreadsheets, which was fine to a certain extent. The main disadvantages were the collation of data, input of the data to the various spreadsheets and being unable to produce meaningful reports from various elements of that system.<BR>
 <BR>
Within a short time of viewing the capabilities of <i>football.mitoo</i> I could see this would be a far better way of maintaining league records and early in August I asked Julian to set the Hellenic League up as a <i>football.mitoo</i> user. Since then things have progressed well with myself and Assistant Sec/Treasurer, Clive Webb, dealing with the data input on a day by day basis. Requests have been made to Julian for some enhancements to the system, which have been dealt with in a very professional and speedy manner.<BR>
 <BR>
I would estimate that <font face="#Font_Face#" color="red" size="-1"><b>input time on the player registration and appearance element has been the greatest time saver followed closely by the facility to send player registration lists to member clubs each week.</b></font> The amount of time needed to update the player data base has been halved from last season. The time taken to produce and send up to sixty player registration lists by E-mail and Fax is a far cry from the good old days of 'copy & paste' of Excel spread sheets. Match results are usually posted on the system within an hour of matches ending and league tables are updated instantly and downloaded for inclusion in the League's weekly 'Bootroom Chatter' bulletin.<BR>
 <BR>
<i>football.mitoo</i> is an <font face="#Font_Face#" color="red" size="-1"><b>easy system to understand and operate.</b></font> There are, of course, some limitations to the system but any requests for system enhancements are quickly dealt with and I know there are some changes to the system being written for implementation next season.<BR>
 <BR>
The Hellenic League is into the sixth week of its 50th anniversary season and using <i>football.mitoo</i> has been an added bonus and even allows me some time with my wife and family that I haven't had in previous seasons.<BR>

	As a League Administrator, I see the football.mitoo system as the way
	forward for any football league. It gives a much more
	professional approach to organising and collating fixtures. It has taken
	the stress and time consuming energy away from
	mis-matching eight Divisions of eleven teams. The information/statistics on individual team fixtures, their results
	and progress in Cup Competitions is second to none.
	</font>
	<font face="#Font_Face#" color="red" size="-1"><b>The hard
	work of generating league tables using other software and long winded
	methods has been removed at a stroke.</b> 
	</font>
	<font face="#Font_Face#" color="black" size="-1"> It is an exciting
	programme, it is user friendly, eyecatching and very easy to gain
	competence in using. The standard for football administration has
	been set by the football.mitoo system.
	The modern technologly helps to promote and establish the League as
	creditable and well orgainised. It also gives a wider
	basis/platform to the League for persons interested in local football in
	Middlesex and on a much wider basis - throughout the Country.
	Club secretaries and players can access information at the tip of their
	fingers to be updated of their team's performance, League
	position and results. They can find out who the opposition is next
	week, quicker than waiting for the postman to arrive.
	The transfer of information throughout the League's home paper, whether it
	be to highlight a club's success, League news, or social news
	has generated a wider interest, more discussion and new ideas that the
	League officers can take on board and develop.
	Need I say anymore? I'm delighted with the programme.
