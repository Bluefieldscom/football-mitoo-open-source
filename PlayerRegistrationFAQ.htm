  questions and answers below so everyone can benefit.</span>

  <span class="pix13boldnavy">How do you now delete a player record from the registered 
  player list - when a player has not registered during the season?? I have 100+ 
  records I wish to delete and no simple method of doing so, until you advise.<br />
 <em>Brian King, Hellenic League</em></span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="monopix12"> Log In<br />
  click on <u>Player</u><br />
  click on <u>Registered Players Analysis</u><br />
  click on the club name<br />
  click on the player's name you want to delete<br />
  click on <u>upd/del</u> in the Registrations column<br />
  click on the Delete button<br />
  <br />
  If you then want to delete players who are "Not Registered" do this.......<br />
  <br />
  Log In<br />
  click on <u>Player</u><br />
  click on <u>See Unregistered</u><br />
  click on the player's name you want to delete<br />
  click on the Delete button - this will succeed only if he has made no appearances 
  during the season.<br />

  </span> <span class="pix13boldnavy">Can the default start date of a registration 
  not become the potential first date of a season say 1st August 2005 etc.Brian 
  King, Hellenic League The default start date ought still to be TODAY and end 
  date ought to be 31st May of the current season a sit always is for non contract 
  players. That is another way the new idea will slow the entering considerably. 
  I dare sya this is brought about by a desire to keep player son the system form 
  one season to next, but considering how many change their address etc each season 
  (even dates of birth !!!) it is far safer to re enter them all. That is my personal 
  opinion of course byut probably borne out by many other registration officers

  <br /></span>
  <span class="monopix12">I will change the First Day to today's date which should 
  be near the actual date of registration so not too far to navigate to. I will 
  replace the drop down dates to a calendar in the future. If a league requests 
  that all players and their registrations be removed at the start of a season 
  I can easily do this. </span> <br />
  <hr>
  <span class="pix13boldnavy">When a player is transferred his transfer date can 
  then be entered and a new record created from the day following the transfer 
  date<br /><em>Brian King, Hellenic League</em></span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="monopix12"> Transfers do not always involve adjacent time periods. 
  Sometimes a player is deregistered from Club A and there are several days before 
  he is signed by Club B. You will need to update the Club A registration details 
  with a Last Day and then add a Club B registration, specifying the Club name 
  and First Day (and reg. type if necessary). </span> <br />
  <hr>
  <span class="pix13boldnavy">Thank you for your message, but for myself I think 
  removing Registration from the menu bar is going to increase my workload when 
  imputing players suspensions on to the system. At present I was going through 
  the clubs list of players registered by using the registration menu bar, now 
  the only way I can do this by going to the player in question and with just 
  under two thousand players registered this going to take a lot longer.<br /><em>Adrian Marson, Herts Senior County League</em></span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="monopix12"> Try <u>Player</u> then <u>Registered Players Analysis</u><br />
  You can then click on any club name..........<br />
  Then choose a player and add a suspension as usual.......<br />
  <br />
  </span> <span class="pix13boldnavy">That little bit information help a lot, 
  I have just added some new players on to the site and I found that the new system 
  is going to be easier and a lot quicker. <br /><em>Adrian Marson, Herts Senior County League</em></span><br />
  <hr>
  <span class="pix13boldnavy">I see your improvements, in many ways you 
  certainly have the right idea BUT the beauty of your sytem was that one could 
  enter player registration quickly, the ADD MANY feature meant you could put 
  in the details and then quickly tick the box to add them to thier club, extremely 
  useful when at the start of the season when 30 player forms from one club arrive 
  together. This new system seems ? to wipe out this advantage. <br /><em>Tony Pringle, Halls of Cambridge Sunday Football League</em></span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="monopix12"> If you want to add 30 new players and register them 
  all to the same club.............<br />
  <br />
  Log In<br />
  click on <u>Player</u><br />
  *=*<br />
  click on <u>Add</u><br />
  complete the Adding Player form and then click on the Add button<br />
  You will get 1 player with Reg. Nos. between nnn and nnn showing as Not Registered<br />
  click on <u>add</u> in the Registrations column<br />
  complete the registration and click on the Update button<br />
  repeat steps from *=*<br />
  <br />
  I will add something to remember the current club so that you won't have to 
  choose this every time.<br />
  <hr>
  </span> <span class="pix13boldnavy">Big problems with playing unregistered, 
  all the transferred players now appear as playing unregistered for their original 
  clubs. <br /><em>Tony Pringle, Halls of Cambridge Sunday Football League</em></span><br />
  <br /></span>
  <span class="monopix12"> Not to worry for this season. As I said in my email: 
  Please try the <u>Played while unregistered</u> report. By creating appropriate registrations 
  for these players you can reduce the size of this report. Just update the current 
  registration to have a First Day and blank Last Day and then add a registration 
  for the original club with a blank First Day and a realistic Last Day. <br />
  <hr>
  </span> <span class="pix13boldnavy">Have just checked through registration system 
  from a non-Registration Secretary's point of view, i.e. as Secretary who wants 
  to quickly establish if a player is registered with a particular club for administrative 
  purposes or as Press Officer to check correct spelling of a goalscorer's name 
  or a name for a match programme, without going to "Player" in the menu which 
  is time- consuming, etc. Is it therefore possible for administrators to have 
  a master password to input in the box in the yellow section of the Home page 
  otherwise it means entering the unique code issued for each club to extract 
  the type of information I often need and, again, this is time-consuming? <br /><em>Lawrie Parsons, Robert Gray & Co. Mid Sussex Football League</em></span>

  </span> <span class="pix13boldnavy">Thank you for your prompt assistance. Your 
  suggested way of getting to the club's full list of registered players is fine.<br />
